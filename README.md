# Diabetes Predicition from BRFSS Indicators 

## Notes for clarity:

- All of the models are stored in their respective ipynb files:
- The logistic regression being compared to baseline was performed on the raw dataset. The SVM and CATBoost where done on the raw dataset as well.
- The logistic regression that has its own notebook, the decision tree, random forest, and the XGBoost where performed on a 50/50 split dataset (undersampling).
- We have tested on both raw and undersampled data for each of the models.
- There is a folder called Conference-LaTex-Template in the repository, which contains a bunch of tex for the final report, we submitted this as a pdf, so there is nothing important there.
